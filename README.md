I am a theoretical physicist interested in collective properties of matter. My interest in this
discipline comes from the fact that complex systems that are made up from a macroscopic number 
of constituents may show significantly different behaviour from ...

Currently I hold a position as **Assistant Professor** in the Statistical Physics Group
at the **Centre for Fluid and Complex Systems** at Coventry University.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Broadly, my interest revolves around **collective phenomena** and **quantum systems**.
