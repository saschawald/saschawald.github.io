I am a **theoretical physicist** interested in collective properties of **complex systems**.

These systems are inspiring because of the variety of phenomena complex systems can describe, 
reaching from migrating birds to sozialising humans, from the global climate to the human brain
and even from city infrastructures to quantum computers.
The common feature these examples share is that they represent systems that are made of 
a multitude of individual constituents that come together to form more than just the 
sum of the parts.

I am particularly interested in collective properties of **quantum systems** and I study these 
**complex quantum systems in and out of equilibrium**.
