Sascha is a *theoretical physicist* with a great interest in the description of non-equilibrium effects 
in complex systems. Strong interactions in these systems lead to collective effects that are described 
by statistical mechanics. 

My work focuses on describing such effects that are connected to

- thermalisation of quantum systems
- entanglement in interacting systems
- non-equilibrium quantum phase transitions
- quantum metrology
- network dynamics
- machine learning and quantum computing

Currently, I am a Lecturer and Research Associate at Coventry University.
